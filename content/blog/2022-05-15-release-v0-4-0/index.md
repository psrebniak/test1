Hey Everyone,
We have just released a new version of Difree – 0.4.0. Our main focus was to improve feedback loop in Difree.

## What’s changed?

Our main focus was to improve feedback loop in Difree. We would like to know more what you think about the extension.

1. After each major release (e.g., 0.3.5 → 0.4.0, or 0.8.9 → 1.0.0) we will show the blue dot on the Feedback icon indicating there’s something new in Difree.
2. When you click on the icon, the Feedback pop-up appears.
3. You can leave your feedback there. If you add your e-mail address, we will contact you back.
